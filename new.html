                There is hardly anyone who’s not enamoured by the hand-drawn and computer animation originating from Japan, popularly known as Anime and Manga. Who’s not a fan of famous movies and series like Princess Mononoke, Grave of  the Fireflies, Death Note, One Piece, Dragon Ball Z and countless others? 
                <br><br>
                Now India is going to have its first anime movie and series, as the first Indian anime studio, Studio Durga, has lately launched the trailer of their pilot series Karmachakra: Episode Zero in Bengali. They are the first Indian animation studio that creates anime, or 2D hand-drawn animation in the art-style of Japanese Manga comics, wholly independent of  any foreign collaboration.
                <br><br>
                Based on the trailer the story seems to be of a girl named Ganga who goes to the orphanage she used to live in as a kid for her childhood friend’s funeral. But to her surprise she receives a text from Rick, her friend whose funeral she attended; this left her wondering who was the person in the funeral if it wasn’t Rick. As mentioned in the trailer Rick seems to be hiding with Ganga’s father, who was kidnapped when she was little, never to be seen again. The confusing part of the trailer is where a man is calling out to the person named Abani, though I think it is of real importance to the story’s suspense. The trailer ends with Ganga telling her name to the person who has her in captivity with a smirk on her face.
                <br><br>
                After watching the trailer I feel like it is going to be a crime, suspense and thriller story. The VA is in the Bengali language with English subtitles, I hope they dub it in Hindi(The Indian National Language) and English too for everyone to enjoy it in a language they understand.
